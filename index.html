    Student and Aspiring Software Engineer,gamer,instrumentalist.
    I was simply fascinated with using computers,I suppose all those video games
    and sci-fiction movies. The reason why lam doing programming is because,
    I might as well start my own projects and at my own pace and rules and have my own business
    because this is a career with pretty good pay and conditions and many opportunities.
    Thank you for visiting my website.
